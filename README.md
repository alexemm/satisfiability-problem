# Satisfiability Problem

This repo handles the problems inside of Mathematical Logics, specifically the Satisfiability Problem SAT, which is an NP-complete problem.

## Implemented Solutions

## Propositional Calculus

#### Horn Formula marker algorithm

The marker algorithm for the P-complete problem HORN-SAT is implemented and provided here.

#### Resolution Calculus

This algorithm helps deciding the unsatisfiability of a boolean formula in CNF.
